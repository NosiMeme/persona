<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h2>
<img src="Screenshot 2025-05-12 142303.png" class="Me"> <p>Hi there, I’m Amelia Cornelia Allison. I was born on March 30, 2008, at JFK Hospital in Liberia. For the first 13 years of my life, I experienced the vibrant culture and warmth of Liberia, surrounded by family and friends. Growing up, I didn't have a strong interest in coding, even though I took a computer class at my school back in Liberia. At that time, coding felt somewhat distant, and I wasn't sure how much it would resonate with me in the future.<br>

    However, since moving to the USA, my perspective has shifted dramatically. I discovered a newfound passion for coding, which I now see as a pathway to exciting opportunities and a fulfilling career. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers, and I find joy in creating and problem-solving through code.<br>
    
    </p>
    <p>In addition to coding, I have a strong interest in building things from scratch—whether it's a project I’ve envisioned or even baking delicious treats in the kitchen. There’s something incredibly satisfying about bringing an idea to life, whether through software development or baking a cake. I love collaborating with like-minded people who share similar interests, as there's so much to learn from each other and create together.
    
    Now, my goal is to immerse myself in the world of coding even more, honing my skills and expanding my knowledge so I can build captivating websites and applications. I'm excited for what the future holds and look forward to pursuing a career in tech that allows me to combine my passion for creativity with my love for coding.</p>
