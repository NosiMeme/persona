    <summary>Year 1 2022-2023 - Discovery of Pathway</summary>
    <p>During my first year of high school, I found myself feeling a bit lost when it came to understanding the various pathways available. At that time, my counselor suggested that I explore the pathway of programming, which seemed intriguing yet daunting. I decided to take Mr. Dal's class, where I was introduced to the basics of Java programming. From the very first lesson, I was captivated by the logical thinking and creativity involved in coding. The thrill of being able to create something from scratch was incredibly empowering. This enthusiasm led me to join the TechCorp program at my school, where I had the opportunity to dive deeper into the world of technology. Throughout the year, I participated in group projects and engaged with peers who shared similar interests, which greatly helped refine my skills and boost my confidence in programming. I realized that this pathway offered not just a skill set, but a community and a route toward a promising future in technology.</p>

    <summary>Year 2 2023-2024 - Skills Expansion</summary>
    <p>As I progressed into my second year, my focus shifted towards expanding my coding skills even further. This year, I committed to taking a course in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which provided me with a solid foundation in a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and classes. Alongside this, I began exploring JavaScript, a versatile language that opened up new avenues for building dynamic web applications. I was particularly excited to learn about Swift, essential for iOS development, and felt eager to create apps for mobile devices. Moreover, I discovered p5.js, a library that makes using JavaScript for creative coding accessible and enjoyable. My passion for coding deepened as I took on various projects, including developing simple apps and engaging in coding challenges. I found immense satisfaction in being able to bring my ideas to life through code and started to feel more proficient in my programming abilities.</p>

    <summary>Year 3 2024-2025 -Now </summary>
    <p>As a junior this year, I decided to take on a more practical approach to my studies by engaging in real-world projects that combined my programming knowledge with hands-on experience. Iâ€™m in a Web Design Class, which has allowed me to understand the aesthetics and functionality of creating websites. This experience was enhanced by my coursework in the Math of Computer Science, where I learned the underlying principles behind computational thinking and algorithm design. Through a series of hands-on assignments, I created my projects from scratch, focusing on user experience and interface design. I enjoyed experimenting with different layouts and features, further solidifying my programming skills. This year has not only boosted my technical abilities but also enhanced my critical thinking and problem-solving skills as I prepare for the next steps in my educational journey, including potential internships and college applications.</p>
